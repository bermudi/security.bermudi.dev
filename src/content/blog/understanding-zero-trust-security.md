## What is Zero Trust Security?

Zero Trust is a security framework that requires all users, whether inside or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted access to applications and data.

By implementing Zero Trust, organizations can significantly improve their security posture and better protect against modern cyber threats.
